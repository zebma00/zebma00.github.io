    'Heroic Dungeon bosses drop high quality rare and epic items. Some bosses and mobs have additional abilities and some dungeons have loot or events added, that changes the flow/route from normal mode dungeons. Some of these new routes can be shortened by lock picking. The following Heroic Dungeons have been added: Zul’Farrak, Maraudon, The Temple of Atal’Hakkar, Blackrock Depths, Stratholme, Scholomance, Dire Maul, Blackrock Spire*, Ragefire Chasm (Horde only), Shadowfang Keep (Horde only), The Stockades (Alliance only), Gnomeregan (Alliance only).',
    '*Although (upper) Blackrock Spire is technically a raid, the quality of items should be similar to heroic dungeons.',
